My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2030787429">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Insanely creative and beautiful piece of fiction. It has the spirit of the classics of the genre and at the same time innovates and combines an spectacular arrange of topics. This book is about anthropology, evolution, space exploration, theology and gender equality. And probably more. Tchaikovsky did a wonderful job by polishing the "perspective of the alien". His effort in avoiding the recurrent anthropomorphism of this kind of novels makes him deserve a space among the masters -the "<i>Messengers</i>" ;)- of science fiction.<br /><br />We are attending the birth of a classic.
